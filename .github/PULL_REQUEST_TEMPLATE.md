## Description

<!--
Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue. Linking an issue can be done by mentioning a key word (`closes #111`, `fixes #222`, `resolve #333`) or manually on github.com, even after the pull request is created. 

Note: If your PR involves benchmarks, you can run the `Benchmarks` workflow by adding `action:benchmarks` label. The PR must be opened from Promscale branch so that Github actions can leave a comment comparing results against `master`.
