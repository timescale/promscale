This project connects Prometheus to TimescaleDB, creating an
**analytical and long-term storage platform for Prometheus metrics**.

<img src="./docs/timescale-prometheus-arch.png>

This platform is **horizontally-scalable**, **highly-compressed**, and
**operationally mature**. By allowing a user to use SQL, in addition to
PromQL, this platform empowers the user to ask complex analytical
queries from their metrics data, and thus extract more meaningful
insights.

For a detailed description of this architecture, please see [our design
doc][design-doc].

### About TimescaleDB

**[TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb)** is a
**distributed time-series database built on PostgreSQL** that scales to
over 10 million of metrics per second, supports native compression,
handles high cardinality, and offers native time-series capabilities,
such as data retention policies, continuous aggregate views,
downsampling, data gap-filling and interpolation.

TimescaleDB also supports full SQL, a variety of data types (numerics,
text, arrays, JSON, booleans), and ACID semantics. Operationally mature
capabilities include high-availability, streaming backups, upgrades over
time, roles and permissions, and security.

TimescaleDB has a **large and active user community** (tens of millions
of downloads, hundreds of thousands of active deployments, Slack channel
with 4,000+ members). Users include Comcast, Fujitsu,
Schneider Electric, Siemens, Walmart, Warner Music, and thousands of
others.

TimescaleDB is already the main metrics database behind one of the
largest monitoring providers in the world, and is the preferred
time-series database backend natively supported by Zabbix. It is
natively supported by Grafana via the PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB datasource.

## Getting started with Helm (recommended)

The quickest way to get started is by using the Helm chart from
[timescale-observability](https://github.com/timescale/timescale-observability),
which provides a broader framework for installing an end-to-end
monitoring stack.

The following command will install Prometheus, TimescaleDB,
Timescale-Prometheus Connector, and Grafana
into your Kubernetes cluster:
```
helm repo add timescale https://charts.timescale.com/
helm repo update
helm install --devel <release_name> timescale/timescale-observability
```

## Quick tips

### Configuring Data Retention

By default, data is stored for 90 days and then deleted.
This default can be changed in SQL by using the SQL function
`set_default_retention_period(new interval)`.  For example,
```
SELECT set_default_retention_period(180 * INTERVAL '1 day')
```

You can also override this default on a per-metric basis using
the SQL function `set_metric_retention_period(metric_name, interval)`
and undo this override with `reset_metric_retention_period(metric_name)`.

Note: The default applies to all metrics that do not have override,
no matter whether they were created before or after the call to
`set_default_retention_period`.

### Working with SQL data

We describe how to use our pre-defined views and functions to work with the prometheus data in [the SQL schema doc](docs/sql_schema.md).

A Reference for our SQL API is [available here](docs/sql_api.md).

## Advanced

### Configuring the Helm Chart

To get a fully-documented configuration file for
`timescale-observability`, please run:

```
helm show values timescale/timescale-observability > my_values.yml
```

You can then edit `my_values.yml` and deploy the release with the
following command:

```
helm upgrade --install <release_name> --values my_values.yml timescale/timescale-observability
```

By default, the `timescale-observability` Helm chart sets up a
single-instance of TimescaleDB; if you are
interested in a replicated setup for high-availabilty with automated
backups, please see
[this github repo](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb-kubernetes/tree/master/charts/timescaledb-single) for additional instructions.

### Helm (sub)chart for Timescale-Prometheus Connector only

A Helm chart for only the Timescale-Prometheus Connector is available in
the [helm-chart directory](helm-chart/README.md) of this repository.

This is used as a dependency from the `timescale-observability` Helm
chart and can be used as a dependency in your own custom Helm chart.

## Non-Helm deployment

### Non-Helm installation methods

Any non-helm installations also need to make sure the `drop_chunks`
procedure on a regular
basis (e.g. via CRON). We recommend executing it every 30 minutes.
This is necessary to execute data retention policies according to the 
configured policy. This is set up automatically in helm.

We also recommend running this with a Timescaledb installation that
includes the `timescale_prometheus_extra`
Postgres extension. While this isn't a requirement, it does optimize
certain queries. A docker image of Timescaledb with the extension is
available at on Docker Hub at
[`timescaledev/timescale_prometheus_extra:latest-pg12`](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescaledev/timescale_prometheus_extra).
Instructions on how to compile and install the extension are in the
extensions [README](extension/Readme.md).

#### Binaries

You can download pre-built binaries for the Timescale-Prometheus
Connector [on our release page](https://github.com/timescale/timescale-prometheus/releases).

#### Docker

A docker image for the Timescale-Prometheus Connector is available
on Docker Hub at [timescale/timescale-prometheus](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescale/timescale-prometheus/).

A docker image of timescaledb with the `timescale_prometheus_extra`
extension is available at on Docker Hub at
[`timescaledev/timescale_prometheus_extra:latest-pg12`](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescaledev/timescale_prometheus_extra).

#### Building from source

Before building, make sure the following prerequisites are installed:

* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

The Timescale-Prometheus Connector is a Go project managed by go
modules. You can download it in
any directory and on the first build it will download it's required
dependencies.

```bash
# Fetch the source code of Timescale-Prometheus in any directory
$ git clone git@github.com:timescale/timescale-prometheus.git
$ cd ./timescale-prometheus

# Install the Timescale-Prometheus Connector binary (will automatically detect and download)
# dependencies.
$ cd cmd/timescale-prometheus
$ go install

# Building without installing will also fetch the required dependencies
$ go build ./...
```

You can build the Docker container using the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile).

### Non-Helm Configuration

#### Configuring Prometheus to use this remote storage connector

You must tell prometheus to use this remote storage connector by adding
the following lines to `prometheus.yml`:
```
remote_write:
  - url: "http://<connector-address>:9201/write"
remote_read:
  - url: "http://<connector-address>:9201/read"
```

#### Configuring Prometheus to filter which metrics are sent (optional)

You can limit the metrics being sent to the adapter (and thus being
stored in your long-term storage) by setting up `write_relabel_configs`
in Prometheus, via the `prometheus.yml` file.
Doing this can reduce the amount of space used by your database and thus
increase query performance.

The example below drops all metrics starting with the prefix `go_`,
which matches Golang process information exposed by exporters like
`node_exporter`:

```
remote_write:
 - url: "http://timescale_prometheus_connector:9201/write"
   write_relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__name__]
        regex: 'go_.*'
        action: drop
```

Additional information about setting up relabel configs, the
`source_labels` field, and the possible actions can be found in the
[Prometheus Docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write).

#### Configuring the Timescale-Prometheus Connector Binary

The Timescale-Prometheus Connector Binary is configured either through
CLI flags or environment variables. The list of all available flags is
displayed on the help `timescale-prometheus -h` command. All
environment variables are prefixed with `TS_PROM`.
