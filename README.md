Promscale is an open-source long-term store for Prometheus data designed for
analytics. It is a **horizontally scalable**, **highly-compressed**, and
**operationally mature** platform for Prometheus data that offers the
combined power of PromQL and SQL, enabling developers to ask any question,
create any dashboard, and achieve greater visibility into their systems.
Promscale is built on top of [TimescaleDB](https://www.timescale.com/), the
leading relational database for time-series.

By allowing a user to use SQL, in addition to
PromQL, this platform empowers the user to ask complex analytical
queries from their metrics data, and thus extract more meaningful
insights.

‚úÖ  Promscale is currently the only long-term store for Prometheus data to have received a
[100% compliance test score](https://promlabs.com/promql-compliance-test-results-timescaledb)
(with no cross-cutting concerns) from PromLab's
[PromQL Compliance Test Suite](https://promlabs.com/promql-compliance-tests/).

For a detailed description of this architecture, please see [our design
doc][design-doc].

## üêØ About TimescaleDB

**[TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb)** is a
**distributed time-series database built on PostgreSQL** that scales to
over 10 million of metrics per second, supports native compression,
handles high cardinality, and offers native time-series capabilities,
such as data retention policies, continuous aggregate views,
downsampling, data gap-filling and interpolation.

TimescaleDB also supports full SQL, a variety of data types (numerics,
text, arrays, JSON, booleans), and ACID semantics. Operationally mature
capabilities include high-availability, streaming backups, upgrades over
time, roles and permissions, and security.

TimescaleDB has a **large and active user community** (tens of millions
of downloads, hundreds of thousands of active deployments, Slack channel
with 4,000+ members). Users include Comcast, Fujitsu,
Schneider Electric, Siemens, Walmart, Warner Music, and thousands of
others.

Developers and organizations around the world trust TimescaleDB with their
time-series data. AppDynamics (now part of Cisco Systems and one of the
largest application performance monitoring providers) relies on TimescaleDB
as its main metrics database. TimescaleDB is also the preferred (recommended)
backend datasource for Zabbix users and is natively supported in Grafana.

* **Analysis in PromQL and SQL** get the ability to analyze data in both query languages. Use PromQL for monitoring and alerting and
  SQL for deeper analytics and compatibility with a huge ecosystem of data visualization, analysis, and AI/ML tools.
* **Rock-solid stability** due to being built on top of PostgreSQL, with 30+ years of development work.
* **Support for backfilling** to ingest data from the past.
* **High-Availability** support for [Promethus HA deployments](docs/high-avaliability/prometheus-HA.md) as well as
  high-availability deployments of [TimescaleDB itself](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/high-availability-timescaledb-postgresql-patroni-a4572264a831/).
* **Simple architecture**. Unlike some other long-term stores, our architecture consists of only three components: Prometheus, Promscale, and TimescaleDB.
* **ACID compliance** to ensure consistency of your data.
* **Horizontal scalability** using [multiinode support](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/timescaledb-2-0-a-multi-node-petabyte-scale-completely-free-relational-database-for-time-series/) with TimescaleDB version 2.0.

## üîß Choose your own (installation) adventure

We have four main ways to set up Promscale:

#### tobs (recommended for Kubernetes environments)

[The Observability Suite for Kubernetes][tobs] is a
CLI tool and Helm chart that makes installing a full observability suite into your
Kubernetes cluster really easy. Tobs includes Prometheus, TimescaleDB,
Promscale Connector, and Grafana.

To get started, run the following in your terminal, then follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSLf  https://tsdb.co/install-tobs-sh |sh
```

Or visit the [tobs GitHub repo][tobs] for more information and instructions
on advanced configuration.

#### üê≥ Docker

We provide [docker images](https://github.com/timescale/promscale/releases) with every release.

Instructions on how to use our docker images are available [here](docs/docker.md).

#### üîü Binaries

We have [pre-packaged binaries](https://github.com/timescale/promscale/releases) available for MacOS and Linux on both the x86_64 and i386 architectures.
Instructions on how to use our prepackaged binaries are available [here](docs/binary.md).

You can also [build binaries from source](docs/binary.md#building-from-source).

#### ‚éà Helm (sub)chart for Promscale Connector only

A Helm chart for only the Promscale Connector is available in
the [helm-chart directory](helm-chart/README.md) of this repository.

This is used as a Helm dependency from the `tobs`
[Helm chart](https://github.com/timescale/tobs/tree/master/chart) and can be used as a dependency in your own custom Helm chart as well.

## üîç Analyzing the data using SQL

We describe how to use our pre-defined views and functions to work with the prometheus data in [the SQL schema doc](docs/sql_schema.md).

A Reference for our SQL API is [available here](docs/sql_api.md).

## üí° Quick tips

### Configuring Data Retention

By default, data is stored for 90 days and then deleted. This
default can be changed globally or overridden for individual
metrics.

If using tobs, these settings can be changed using the
`tobs metrics retention` command (use
`tobs metrics retention -h` to see all options).

These setting can also be changed using the appropriate
[SQL commands](docs/sql_schema.md#data-retention).

### üåê Prometheus HTTP API

The Promscale Connector can be used directly as a Prometheus Data
Source in Grafana, or other software.

The connector implements some endpoints of the currently stable (V1) [Prometheus HTTP
API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api). The API is
accessible at `http://<promscale_connector_address>:9201/api/v1` and can be
used to execute instant or range PromQL queries against the data in
TimescaleDB, as well as retrieve the metadata for series, label names and
label values.

A Reference for the implemented endpoints of the Prometheus HTTP API is [available here](docs/prometheus_api.md)

### Configuring Prometheus to filter which metrics are sent (optional)

You can limit the metrics being sent to the adapter (and thus being
stored in your long-term storage) by setting up `write_relabel_configs`
in Prometheus, via the `prometheus.yml` file.
Doing this can reduce the amount of space used by your database and thus
increase query performance.

The example below drops all metrics starting with the prefix `go_`,
which matches Golang process information exposed by exporters like
`node_exporter`:

```
remote_write:
 - url: "http://promscale_connector:9201/write"
   write_relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__name__]
        regex: 'go_.*'
        action: drop
```

Additional information about setting up relabel configs, the
`source_labels` field, and the possible actions can be found in the
[Prometheus Docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_write).
