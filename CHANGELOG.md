## Unreleased

### Added
- Alerts from promscale monitoring mixin are groupped also by namespace label [#1714]
- Added a new family of metrics tracking database maintenance jobs durations and failures [#1745]
- Allow config options in file to be set as yaml mappings [#1737]
- Add `startup.dataset` option in the config file for the dataset
  configuration. Supersedes `startup.dataset.config` which accepts a string
  instead of a mapping [#1737]
- Add alert to notify about duplicate sample/metric ingestion. [#1688]

### Changed
- Reduced the verbosity of the logs emitted by the vacuum engine [#1715]
- The vacuum engine now throttles the number of workers used based on the oldest txid from
  the chunks needing freezing [#1761]
- In order to reduce the overall load on the system, some internal database
  metrics won't be collected as often as they used to. None of the affected 
  metrics is expected to change faster than its new collection interval [#1793]
