# Multi-tenancy

Promscale supports multi-tenancy by having different Prometheus servers
corresponding to different tenants all write data to the same set of Promscale
servers. Each Prometheus server will indicate the tenant it is writing using
either custom headers or external labels.

When executing PromQL queries, a Promscale server can be configured to either
return data for all tenants or to restrict its answers to a particular tenant or set of tenants.
In this way, a tenant can be given access to a particular Promscale PromQL endpoint for
querying its own data while being sure that it could not access other tenant's data.

Multi-tenancy in Promscale features:
1. Simple configuration for multi-tenancy using headers or external labels
2. Cross-tenant queries in PromQL and SQL
3. Allow data with no tenant information to be written or queried when multi-tenant mode is enabled
4. Restricting the set of valid tenants a Promscale instance can ingest or query
5. Authorization of tenants using bearer_tokens

## Configuring Promscale for multi-tenancy

By default, Promscale ingests data without multi-tenancy. However, configuring Promscale for multi-tenancy is simple.
For Promscale to ingest tenant data, apply the `-multi-tenancy` flag during the start. This will allow Promscale to
ingest data from all tenants by default. If you want Promscale to ingest or query data from a restricted list of tenants, mention the
tenant names in `-multi-tenancy-valid-tenants=<tenant_name_seperated_by_commas>`.

When multi-tenancy is enabled, accepting data without a tenant name being specified is disabled by default.
If you want to accept data without the tenant information, apply the `-multi-tenancy-allow-non-tenants` flag.

Remember to set the appropriate CLI flags on all of your Promscale instances.

Example:

If we want to ingest data from `tenant-A` and `tenant-B` Prometheus instances and also allow data to
be ingested from non-tenant instances of Prometheus, then the required configuration flags will be:

```shell
-multi-tenancy -multi-tenancy-valid-tenants=tenant-A,tenant-B -multi-tenancy-allow-non-tenants
```

If we want to ingest all incoming tenant data (i.e., irrespective of tenant validation) from
Prometheus instances along with non-tenant Prometheus instances

```shell
-multi-tenancy -multi-tenancy-allow-non-tenants
```

Note: `-multi-tenancy-valid-tenants` has a default value as `allow-all`.

## Configuring Prometheus for writing multi-tenant data

Promscale happily accepts tenant information either via `headers` or using `external_labels`.
You can choose either of the ways depending on your needs.

Promscale keeps tenant name as `__tenant__: <tenant_name>` label pair attached to the series that is
ingested in that tenant's write-request.

### Using headers

Tenant name can be supplied with a header with the key `TENANT` and the value corresponding the tenant name.

Example:

`TENANT: tenant-A`

In Prometheus remote-write config

```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: http://localhost:9201/write
    headers:
      TENANT: A
```

### Using external_labels

Promscale reserves `__tenant__` as label_key for storing tenant name for the incoming series. You can
push data directly with this label as

```yaml
global:
  external_labels:
    __tenant__: A
```

## Querying multi-tenant data

Since data from any tenant is kept with a `__tenant__` label key, it can be used to query any tenant data.
Please note only those tenants are allowed in the query that is authorized under `-multi-tenancy-valid-tenants`
flag. Moreover, data without a tenant label can be queried only if `-multi-tenancy-allow-non-tenants` is applied.

If a query aims to be evaluated across multiple tenants (say tenant-A and tenant-B), it can be done
by `metric_name{__tenant__=~"tenant-A|tenant-B"}` respectively.

Example:

Imagine if Promscale contains data from `tenant-A`, `tenant-B` and `tenant-C`. If Promscale is configured with
`-multi-tenancy-valid-tenants=tenant-A,tenant-B` then,

If the PromQL query is
1. `metric_name{__tenant__=tenant-A}` then data corresponding to `metric_name` from `tenant-A` will
   only be returned.
2. `metric_name{__tenant__=tenant-C}` then no data will be returned.
3. `metric_name{__tenant__=~tenant-A|tenant-B}` then data from `metric_name` from tenants `tenant-A` and `tenant-B`
   will be returned.
4. `metric_name{__tenant__=~tenant-A|tenant-C}` then data from `metric_name` will be only from `tenant-A` and
   not from `tenant-C`. This is because the Promscale instance is configured to return data from only `tenant-A` and `tenant-B`.
5. `metric_name` then the data from `metric_name` will be from `tenant-A` and `tenant-B` only.

Now, if the same database also contains samples without any tenant label and `-multi-tenancy-allow-non-tenants` is applied then

If the PromQL query is
1. `metric_name{__tenant__=tenant-A}` then data corresponding to `metric_name` from `tenant-A` will
   only be returned.
2. `metric_name{__tenant__=tenant-A|}` then data corresponding to `metric_name` from non-tenant and from `tenant-A`
   will be returned.
3. `metric_name` then data corresponding to `metric_name` will be from the non-tenants, `tenant-A` and `tenant-B` respectively.
4. `metric_name{__tenant__=""}` then data will be only from non-tenants.

Note: If you are querying from multiple Promscales, you can **also** configure individual Promscale instances (differently) to selectively
authorize any valid tenant for queries, based on your requirement.
