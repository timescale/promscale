## üîß Running Docker

A docker image for the Promscale Connector is available
on Docker Hub at [timescale/promscale](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescale/promscale/).

To fetch the latest Promscale image, please refer to the [releases](https://github.com/timescale/promscale/releases)
section of Promscale github repository.

A docker image of TimescaleDB with the `promscale`
extension is available at on Docker Hub at
[`timescaledev/promscale-extension:latest-ts2-pg13`](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescaledev/promscale-extension). You can
install this via `docker pull timescaledev/promscale-extension:latest-ts2-pg13`.

The `ts2-pg13` suffix means TimescaleDB version 2 on PostgreSQL version 13. We also publish images to DockerHub for other combinations of TimescaleDB and PostgreSQL versions in case you have specific version requirements.

**Example using docker:**

First, let's create a network specific to Promscale-TimescaleDB.

```dockerfile
docker network create --driver bridge promscale-timescaledb
```

Install and run TimescaleDB with Promscale extension:
```dockerfile
docker run --name timescaledb -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<password> -d -p 5432:5432 --network promscale-timescaledb timescaledev/promscale-extension:latest-ts2-pg13 postgres -csynchronous_commit=off
```

Finally, let's run Promscale:
```dockerfile
docker run --name promscale -d -p 9201:9201 --network promscale-timescaledb timescale/promscale:latest -db-password=<password> -db-port=5432 -db-name=postgres -db-host=timescaledb -db-ssl-mode=allow
```
If you want to run a specific version of Promscale, replace latest with the specific version you want to run. You can see all versions available in [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/timescale/promscale/tags)


**Note:** `db-ssl-mode=allow` is just for explanatory purposes. In production environments,
we advise you to use `db-ssl-mode=require` for security purposes.

This should make Promscale running along with TimescaleDB.

**Example using docker-compose:**

You can also run Promscale also by using docker-compose. The `docker-compose.yaml` is available in the
[docker-compose](https://github.com/timescale/promscale/blob/master/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml) directory of our repository.
You can start Promscale and related services simply via `docker-compose up`.

For updating Promscale in this method, you need to stop the Promscale that is currently running using
`docker-compose stop` and then pull the image with the tag you want to upgrade to with `docker pull timescale/promscale:<version-tag>`.
This will pull the respective image to your local docker registry. You can then run the updated image with `docker-compose up`.

## üïû Setting up cron jobs for Timescale DB 1.X

If you are using TimescaleDB 1.X you need to make sure the `execute_maintenance()`
procedure is run on a regular basis (e.g. via cron). This is not needed if you are
using TimescaleDB 2.X because it has native support for task scheduling which
is automatically configured by Promscale to run the `execute_maintenance()`
procedure.

We recommend executing it every
30 minutes. This is necessary to execute maintenance tasks such as enforcing
data retention policies according to the configured policy.

**Example:**

```bash
docker exec \
   --user postgres \
   timescaledb \
      psql \
        -c "CALL execute_maintenance();"
```

## üî• Configuring Prometheus to use this remote storage connector

You must tell prometheus to use this remote storage connector by adding
the following lines to `prometheus.yml`:
```yaml
remote_write:
  - url: "http://<connector-address>:9201/write"
remote_read:
  - url: "http://<connector-address>:9201/read"
    read_recent: true
```

**Note:** Setting `read_recent` to `true` will make Prometheus query data from Promscale for all PromQL queries. This is highly recommended.

You can configure Prometheus remote-write with our recommended configurations from [here](/docs/configuring_prometheus.md). 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The Promscale Connector binary is configured through either CLI flags, environment variables, or a YAML configuration file. 

All environment variables are prefixed with `PROMSCALE`.

Configuration file is a YAML file where the keys are CLI flag names and values are their respective flag values.

The list of available cli flags is available in [here](/docs/configuration.md) in
our docs or by running with the `-h` flag (e.g. `promscale -h`).

## üõ† Building from source

You can build the Docker container using the [Dockerfile](build/Dockerfile).
