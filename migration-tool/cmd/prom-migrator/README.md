# Prom-migrator

Prom-migrator is an **open-source**, **community-driven** and **free-to-use**, **universal prometheus
data migration tool**, that migrates data from one storage system to another, leveraging Prometheus's
remote storage endpoints. You can read more about Prom-migrator in our [blog post](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/introducing-prom-migrator-a-universal-open-source-prometheus-data-migration-tool/).

### Unique features

* Migrate prometheus data from one storage system to another
* Pretty outputs during runtime, allowing users to track progress
* Ability to resume migration(s) from last sent data, in case of any unintended shutdowns
* Ability to attempt for retry in case of timeout or error
* Stateless working model

## Working overview

Prom-migrator migrates the data from one storage to another. It pulls the data from a particular remote
storage system using the remote-read endpoint for a certain time-range. It then pushes the data to another
remote storage system using the remote-write endpoint. It continues by reading and then writing more data
until it finishes the entire time-range specified by the user. The time-range of any individual read is
adaptively auto-adjusted to bound the overall memory usage of the system.

The system is able to auto-resume the migration if a previous migration was interrupted. It does this by
adding a progress-metric to the data as it is writing. The sample of the progress metric records the
maximum time that was written. Thus, when a migration process resumes, it simply reads the progress-metric
to find out what was last written and picks up where it left off.

## Storage systems

Storage systems that we aim to support with prom-migrator are:

Key:
* read - means data can be read from system,
* write - means data can be written to an empty database,
* backfill - means data can be written to a database that already contains data newer than what is being
  inserted.

1. Promscale (read, write, backfill)
2. Prometheus (read)
3. Prometheus tsdb (TODO)
4. Thanos (read, write)
5. Cortex (only blocks storage, chunks storage in later versions) (read, write)
6. VictoriaMetrics (read, write, not sure about backfill)
7. M3DB (read, write, not sure about backfill)
8. Others (any remote storage systems with remote read (for reading) and write (for writing) endpoints)

It should be noted that some above systems do not support backfill and so their ability to serve
as write endpoints are somewhat constrained.

#### Example

```shell
./prom-migrator -start=1606408552 -end=1606415752 -reader-url=<read_endpoint_url_for_remote_read_storage> -writer-url=<write_endpoint_url_for_remote_write_storage> -progress-metric-url=<read_endpoint_url_for_remote_write_storage>
```

**Note:** Prom-migrator does not support migrating data to a HA environment. If you have an HA setup,
try running it in non-HA mode to ingest data from prom-migrator.

|   writer-on-timeout    |  string  |  false   |             `"retry"`              | When a timeout happens during the write process, how should the writer behave. Valid options: ['retry', 'skip', 'abort']. If 'retry', the writer retries to push the current slab after the delay. If 'skip', the writer skips the current slab that is being pushed and moves on to the next slab. If 'abort', the migration process will be aborted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|    concurrent-pull     | integer  |  false   |                `1`                 | Concurrent pull enables fetching of data concurrently. Each fetch query is divided into 'concurrent-pull' (value) parts and then fetched concurrently. This allows higher throughput of read by pulling data faster from the remote-read storage. Note: Setting 'concurrent-pull' > 1 will show progress of concurrent fetching of data in the progress-bar and disable real-time transfer rate. High 'concurrent-pull' can consume significant memory, so make sure you balance this with your number of migrating series and available memory. Also, setting this value too high may cause TLS handshake error on the read storage side or may lead to starvation of fetch requests, depending on your network bandwidth. |
|    concurrent-push     | integer  |  false   |                `1`                 | Concurrent push enables pushing of slabs concurrently. Each slab is divided into 'concurrent-push' (value) parts and then pushed to the remote-write storage concurrently. This may lead to higher throughput on the remote-write storage provided it is capable of handling the load. Note: Larger shards count will lead to significant memory usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

If you do not want any extra metric(s) while migration, you can set this to false. But, setting this to false will disable progress-metric and hence, the ability to resume migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**Note:** A simple way to find timestamp in seconds unix, you can simply query in Prometheus's (or related
platform) UI and see the start/end timestamp. If in decimal, the part prior to the decimal point will be
the timestamp in seconds unix.

### Authentication flags

**Note:** Currently, credentials are expected to be supplied via CLI. In later versions,
reading credentials from files (recommended for security reasons than providing credentials through CLI)
will be supported.
